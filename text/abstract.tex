\addchap{Abstract}
In this work we integrate collaborative models that make use fo Stochastic Gradient
Variational Bayes with more recent posterior distribution approximation improvements,
such as the Normalizing Flows.
Modifications to gradient-based parameter update algorithms are intruduced
in order to take into account the sparsity of the data tensors.
Extensive hyperparameter search is performed and regularizing techniques have been investigated.
