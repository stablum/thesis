\addchap{Abstract}
In this work we integrate collaborative models that make use of Stochastic Gradient
Variational Bayes with more recent posterior distribution approximation improvements,
such as Planar and RealNVP Normalizing Flows.
A model based on the AutoRec collaborative filtering autoencoder model is being
used as baseline in order to compare it to out Variational-Autoencoder-based, named VaeRec and
its variant VaeRec-NF which makes use of Normalizing Flows.
Modifications to gradient-based parameter update algorithms are introduced
in order to take into account the sparsity of the data tensors.
Extensive hyperparameter search is performed and regularizing techniques have been investigated, such as soft free bits, which employs an adaptive
coefficient to the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the variational lower bound.
Methods to prevent gradient explosion are also utilized.
A novel collaborative filtering input schema that makes use of the concatenation of user 
and item vectors has been tried, 
alongside inputs that make use of solely the item or user vectors.
