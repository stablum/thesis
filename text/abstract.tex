\addchap{Abstract}
In this work we integrate collaborative models that make use fo Stochastic Gradient
Variational Bayes with more recent posterior distribution approximation improvements,
such as the Normalizing Flows.
A model based on the AutoRec collaborative filtering autoencoder model is being
used as baseline in order to compare it to out Variational-Autoencoder-based, named VaeRec and
its variant NF-VaeRec which makes use of Normalizing Flows.
Modifications to gradient-based parameter update algorithms are intruduced
in order to take into account the sparsity of the data tensors.
Extensive hyperparameter search is performed and regularizing techniques have been investigated.
A novel collaborative filtering input schema that makes use of the concatenation of user and item vectors has been tried, alongside inputs that make use of solely the item or user vectors.
