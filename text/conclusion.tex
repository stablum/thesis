\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{Future work}

The field of representation learning and autoencoders is currently object of
growing interest from researchers. Specifically, methods to improve posterior
approximations of VAEs are being researched and could be applied to the base model
VAERec. For instance, of particular interest is \emph{Autoregressive Flow}
\cite{autoregressive_flow}

Moreover, \emph{Generative Adversarial Networks} \cite{GAN} seem to be well suited 
for collaborative filtering. The Generator-Discriminator networks might help
obtaining predicted ratings that are as "real" as they could possibly be.
