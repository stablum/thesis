\chapter{Experiments}
This chapter presents experiments on our models.
At first some contextual information is given, such as details on technologies that have
been employed, dataset used, technicalities about scaling of learning rate and regularization coefficients and hyperparameter settings.

Follow results on the experiments runs.
Interesting information on how the model determines learning progress
can be obtained by observation of the RMSE progress over the epochs , both for the
training set and validation set. 
Analysis of the charts provides insight on issues such as hyperparameter choice,
overfitting and underfitting.
