\section{Progress curves}

Interesting information on how the model determines learning progress
can be obtained by observation of the RMSE progress over the epochs , both for the
training set and validation set. 
Analysis of these charts provides insight on issues such as choice of learning rate,
choice of learning rate annealing parameters, overfitting and underfitting.
