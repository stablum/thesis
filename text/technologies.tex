\section{Technologies used}

\subsection{Python version 3}
The Python programming language is well suited for data science applications. Its large
number of libraries available makes it suitable for avoiding re-inventing the wheel.
Its conciseness make it very readable and hands-on.

\subsection{Theano}
It's a Python library useful to create computational graphs and automatic differentiation,
specifically using tensors.

\subsection{DAS4}
Grid computing environment from a partnership between Dutch universities. Allows the use
of concurrent jobs, also on nodes that are provided with GPUs to speed-up deep learning
computations.
