\subsection{Diagnosing the collapse of the posterior approximation to the prior distribution}

Such phenomenon can be diagnosed by looking at the individual Kullback-Leibler divergences
at each latent dimension.

In the case of the diagonal-covariance Multivariate Normal posterior approximation
(the regular VAE), it's easy to find these individual KL values, as it can be analytically determined as:

\begin{nalign}
KL = \log \frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1} + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + ( \mu_1 - \mu_2 )^2}{2\sigma_2^2}-\frac{1}{2}
\end{nalign}

As the prior $\pzi$ is $\normal{\boldzi}{\mathbf{0}}{\mathbf{I}}$, the KL per-dimension is reduced to:

\begin{nalign}
KL = -\log \sigma_1 + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + \mu_1^2}{2}-\frac{1}{2}
\end{nalign}
