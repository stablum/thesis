\section{Rearranging the variational lower bound}

The term $\kl{\qphizcondi}{\pthetaz}$ has an analytical solution within the original
VAE framework with Gaussian approximation of the posterior, 
whence it's not subject to Monte-Carlo sampling.

Unfortunately, by using Normalizing Flows, the $\mathbb{KL}$ cannot be determined
analytically, so it has to be subject to Monte-Carlo sampling.
The negative lower bound $\mathcal{L}(x)$ can be interpreted as
a negative Free-energy (FIXME: look what is "free energy) $-\mathcal{F}(x)$
that has to be minimized.

It's useful to reduce the free energy into it's "atomic" probability components:

\begin{nalign}
\freeenergyxi &= -\elboxi\\
    &= -\expectqphi{\logpjointi - \logqzcondi} \\
    &= \expectqphi{-\logpxicond - \logpz + \logqzcondi}
\end{nalign}

The random multivariate variable $\boldz$ can be interpreted as being the result
of a transformation $\boldz = \tr(\boldzzero)$ of an initial random multivariate variable 
which happens to have a simple distribution, such as multivariate gaussian 
with diagonal covariance matrix.

For the \emph{law of the unconscious statistician} (LOTUS) \cite{lotus} (FIXME: expand)
the energy can have a form with expectations over the simpler distribution of
$\boldzzero$:

\begin{nalign}
\freeenergyxi &= \expectqzero{- \logpxicondtr - \logptr}
+ \expectqphi{\logqzcondi}
\end{nalign}

The last term is clearly the negative entropy of $\qzcondi$:
\begin{nalign}
 \entropyqzcondi &= - \expectqphi{\logqzcondi}
\end{nalign}
    
At this point the previous result on the transformed density can be used in order to express this term as a function of $\qzero$:

\begin{nalign}
    \logqzcondi &= \log q_0(\trinv{\boldz}) + \log \left( |\detDtr{\boldz}|^{-1} \right)\\
     &= \log q_0(\trinv{\boldz}) - \log \left( |\detDtr{\boldz}| \right)
\end{nalign}

By applying the \emph{law of the unconscious statistician} to $-\entropyqzcondi$,
a relationship between the entropy of the two distributions emerges:

\begin{nalign}
     -\entropyqzcondi &= \expectqphi{\logqzcondi}\\
    &= \expectqphi{\log q_0(\trinv{\boldz}) - \log \left( |\detDtr{\boldz}| \right)}\\
    &= \expectqzero{\log q_0(\trinv{\tr(\boldzzero)})}
       - \expectqzero{\log \left( |\detDtr{\tr(\boldzzero)}| \right)}\\
    &= \expectqzero{\log q_0(\boldzzero)}
       - \expectqzero{\log \left( |\detDtr{\tr(\boldzzero)}| \right)}\\
    &= - \entropyqzero - \expectqzero{\log \left( |\detDtr{\tr(\boldzzero)}| \right)}
\end{nalign}
