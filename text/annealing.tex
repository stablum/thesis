\section{Learning rate annealing}

Annealing of the learning rate is a technique that uses the progressive reduction
of the learning rate in order to facilitate achieving an optimum of the parameters.

Intuitively one might think that, as the learning progresses, the parameters 
get progressively near the optimum, and, as a consequence, 
the parameter adjustment needs to be of inferior magnitude than the initial one.
This desirable aspect of the learning is achieved by progressively reducing the
learning rate over the epochs.
