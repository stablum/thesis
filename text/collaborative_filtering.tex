\section{Collaborative Filtering}

\emph{Collaborative Filtering}\cite{Bobadilla2013} is a recomendation system 
technique apt to predict user-item ratings solely via the sparse 
matrix $\mathit{R}$ of the available ratings given by users to items
without using any information about either users or items.
The main aspect that makes CF work is that similar users are recognizable as similar
by having similar ratings on the same items.
Hence, it's possible to predict a missing rating of a user to an item
by considering the ratings of the users that are similar to him.

\begin{nalign}
\begin{array}{ccc}
R = & 
\left[
    \begin{array}{cc>{\columncolor{cyan!20}}ccc}
    r_{1,1} & & \ldots & & r_{1,M} \\
     & \ddots & & \iddots & \\
    \cellcolor{red!20}
     \vdots&\cellcolor{red!20}& \cellcolor{red!20} r_{i,j} &\cellcolor{red!20}&\cellcolor{red!20} \vdots \\
     & \iddots &  & \ddots & \\
    r_{N,1}&  & \ldots & & r_{N,M}
    \end{array}
\right]
&
    \begin{array}{cc}
    \\
    \\
    \leftarrow &\cellcolor{red!20}\textrm{sparse user row } r_{i,\cdot}\\
    \\
    \\
    \end{array}
\\
    &\uparrow&\\
    &\textrm{\colorbox{cyan!20}{sparse item column $r_{\cdot,j}$}} & \\
\end{array}
\end{nalign}
